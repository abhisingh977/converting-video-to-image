# converting-video-to-image
While working on computer vision and deep learning I came across a very frustrating issue of creating a dataset.  Therefore I have written this simple code to ease one expect of the problem. The following notebook will convert a video to images that can be used for creating dataset. I am calculating the pixel-wise difference between two images and producing images who have some difference. 
I belive we can use this technique to remove delay in real time computer vision. I palces where there is less change in relative environment.
